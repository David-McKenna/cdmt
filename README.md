CDMT, for *Coherent Dispersion Measure Trials*, is a software program to coherently dedisperse complex voltage data from the LOFAR telescope to many different dispersion measure trials. It reads HDF5 input data and generates [SIGPROC](http://sigproc.sourceforge.net/) compatible filterbank files.

The software uses NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate the computations.
